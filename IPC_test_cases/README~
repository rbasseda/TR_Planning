The international planning competition is a (nearly) biennial event organized 
in the context of the International Conference on Planning and Scheduling 
(ICAPS).

The competition has different goals, including, providing an empirical 
comparison of the state of the art of planning systems, highlighting challenges
to the Planning community, proposing new directions for research and new links 
with other fields of AI, and providing new data sets to be used by the research 
community as benchmarks.
