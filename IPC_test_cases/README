State space planning algorithms have been considered as one of the
main classical planning techniques to solve classical planning problems since
1960. In this paper, we show that Transaction Logic is an appropriate language
and framework to study and compare these planning algorithms, which enables
one to have more efficient planners in logic programming frameworks. 
Specifically, we take STRIPS planning and forward state space planning 
algorithms, and show that the specification of these algorithms in Transaction 
Logic lets one implement complicated planning algorithms in declarative 
programming languages (e.g. Prolog). The provided test cases can be used by any 
tabled TR interpreter.

The provided test cases here are taken from:

The international planning competition is a (nearly) biennial event organized 
in the context of the International Conference on Planning and Scheduling 
(ICAPS).

The competition has different goals, including, providing an empirical 
comparison of the state of the art of planning systems, highlighting challenges
to the Planning community, proposing new directions for research and new links 
with other fields of AI, and providing new data sets to be used by the research 
community as benchmarks.
