The provided test cases here are taken from:

Moritz Y. Becker, Sebastian Nanz,
"A logic for state-modifying authorization policies", 
ACM Trans. Inf. Syst. Secur. 13(3) (2010)

These test cases represent so called State Modifying Policies (SMP). 
A typical use of such a policy is to determine if a particular access request
(say, to play digital contents) should be granted.
Using SMP approach, updates to the state are factored out of the resource 
guard, thus enhancing maintainability and facilitating more expressive 
policies that take the history of access requests into account.
