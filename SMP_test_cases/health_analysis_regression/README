This test case is based on:

Becker, M.Y.: Information governance in NHS¡'s NPfIT: A case for policy specifi-
cation. International Journal of Medical Informatics 76(5-6) (2007)

This is a simplification of the policy used by 
The UK National Health Service¡'s (NHS) 
National Programme for Information Technology (NPfIT)

The complexity of state-modifying policies calls for analysis tools that support
policy authors in debugging policies. We present a present a classical planning
problem to describe all possible sequences of access requests which yield a 
certain outcome. 

To solve this classical planning problem, we described a sound and complete 
planning algorithm, called fSTRIPS for finding minimal sequences in the
propositional case. The interested reader can find a complete explanation 
of this algorithm in Section 5 of the following paper:
