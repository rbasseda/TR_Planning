This test case is based on the movie store example for State Modifying Policies
explained in:

Moritz Y. Becker, Sebastian Nanz:
A logic for state-modifying authorization policies. ACM Trans. Inf. Syst. Secur. 13(3) (2010)

The first rule describes an action of a user,X, buying a movie,M. The action is
possible only if the movie has not already been purchased by somebody. The 
second rule says that, to play a movie for the first time, the user must buy it
first and not have played it before. 
The third rule deals with the case when the user is happy and decides to keep
the movie. The remaining rules are self-explanatory.

The complexity of state-modifying policies calls for analysis tools that support
policy authors in debugging policies. We present a present a classical planning
problem to describe all possible sequences of access requests which yield a 
certain outcome. 

To solve this classical planning problem, we described a sound and complete 
planning algorithm, called fSTRIPS for finding minimal sequences in the
propositional case. The interested reader can find a complete explanation 
of this algorithm in Section 5 of the following paper:
