This is a compiler that compiles a PDDL 3.0 file to Transaction Logic syntax.

To run the script you need to use the following procedure and signature:

1- Run XSB prolog

2- Load the appropriate compiler. For instance, if you want to generate FSTRIPS, load it as:

:- ['FSTRIPS_Generator.P'].

3- Query pddl2tr with the following signature:

pddl2tr(SourceDir, DestDir,DomainFile,ProblemFile,Planner).

To run the whole compiler from command line, you can use XSB '-e' option.

For example:

xsb -e "['FSTRIPS_Generator.P'],pddl2tr('~/Projects/SMP/src/smp_test/IPC/strips2tr/planner/aips00/Blocks/Track1/Typed/','~/Projects/SMP/src/smp_test/blocks/','domain.pddl','probBLOCKS-5-1.pddl','STRIPS'),halt."
