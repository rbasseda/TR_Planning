This subdirectory contains all the domains used in round1 and round2
of the competition.  Most have two versions, one adl, one strips.
"Assembly" has only an adl version.  "Grid" has only a strips
version. 

The logistics-adl domain was discovered to have a bug after round1.
Although this had no effect on the competition, I include a corrected
version here to forestall criticism.
