This directory contains problem generators used in the competition.

Most of the generators produce problem definition in the form of a
Lisp S-expression ("(define (problem ...) ...)") which is then printed
or converted to Strips form using the utilities in genutil.lisp.  The
file randogrid.lisp, however, which was written in collaboration with
Manuela Veloso, prints problems directly to a file.
